# DengAI disease prediction
This project is part of the competition on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/). The repo contains 3 jupyter notebooks.
1. [Data cleaning and data preprocessing notebook](https://github.com/kongaevans/DengAI/blob/master/Dengue_disease_cleaning.ipynb).
2. [Visualization notebook](https://github.com/kongaevans/DengAI/blob/master/Dengeue_disease_visualization.ipynb).
3. [Modeling notebook](https://github.com/kongaevans/DengAI/blob/master/Modeling%20%20Dengue%20fever%20using%20CatBoost%20model.ipynb) - I used Catboost model.
I never did any feature engineering but the results were hilarious.
