# DengAI disease prediction

# Problem Statement
In recent years dengue fever has been spreading. Historically, the disease has been most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. These days many of the nearly half billion cases per year are occurring in Latin America:

Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce—can you predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?

The repo contains 3 jupyter notebooks.
1. [Data cleaning and data preprocessing notebook](https://github.com/kongaevans/DengAI/blob/master/Dengue_disease_cleaning.ipynb).
2. [Visualization notebook](https://github.com/kongaevans/DengAI/blob/master/Dengeue_disease_visualization.ipynb).
3. [Modeling notebook](https://github.com/kongaevans/DengAI/blob/master/Modeling%20%20Dengue%20fever%20using%20CatBoost%20model.ipynb) - I used Catboost model.
